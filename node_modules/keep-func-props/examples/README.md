This directory contains examples of this library.

To execute them, first [install](../README.md#install) `keep-func-props`. Then
run `node node_modules/keep-func-props/examples/main.js`.

You can edit the example.

They can also be run directly
[in your browser](https://repl.it/@ehmicky/keep-func-props).
