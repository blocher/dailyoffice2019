# Daily Office, Book of Common Prayer 2019 (https://www.dailyoffice2019.com)
This project is used to build the website https://www.dailyoffice2019.com.  It is a Django application written in Python (to be installed in a development environment).  It is used to produce a static html and javascript site which can then be deployed to the production environment.

## WHAT IS THE SITE FOR?
The site invites you to join with Christians around the world in praying with the Church, at any time or in any place you may find yourself. It makes it easy to pray daily morning, midday, evening, and compline (bedtime) prayer without flipping pages, searching for scripture readings or calendars, or interpreting rubrics. The prayers are presented from The Book of Common Prayer (2019) of the Anglican Church in North America and reflect the ancient patterns of daily prayer Christians have used since the earliest days of the church.

## WHAT IS THE DAILY OFFICE?
Daily Morning Prayer and Daily Evening Prayer are the established rites (offices) by which, both corporately and individually, Godâ€™s people annually encounter the whole of the Holy Scriptures, daily confess their sins and praise Almighty God, and offer timely thanksgivings, petitions, and intercessions.

- Import `unzip -p site/dailyoffice_2024_01_30.sql.zip dailyoffice_2024_01_30.sql | psql -U dailyoffice dailyoffice`

#### Setup up python environment

- Create a Python virtual environment `python3 -m venv env`
- Load virtual environment `source env/bin/activate`
- Install Python Requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run API server (in separate terminal)
- Collect static assets `python manage.py collectstatic`
- Start development server `python manage.py runsslserver`
- The API documentation will be accessible locally at `https://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`

#### Run the client (frontend) server
- Go to the project's `/app` directory
- Follow the setup instructions in the client README: [app/README.md](app/README.md)
- The frontend will be accessible locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

### Code formatting standard
- Please use `black` to format code with a line length of 119 beore submitting a pull request
- `find . -iname "*.py" | xargs black --target-version=py311 --line-length=119` from the `site` directory

## Quick overview
The application is built around several Django "apps".  The most important are:

- *website*: This is the base site.  All settings are defined in `website\settings.py` and all paths are defined in `website\routes.py`. Start here.
- *office*: This is where the bulk of the work is down to generate each Office.
- *churchcal*: This is used to build the church calendar. It currently supports both the Anglican Church in North America and the Episcopal Church calendars (though only ACNA is currently used for this project)
- *bible*: This is used to retrieve bible passages from various sources (currently only Bible Gateway, but others such as the ESV API are coming soon)
- *psalter*: This is used to retrieve passages from the Psalms (currently only the renewed Coverdale translation in the Book of Common Prayer 2019)

NOTE: churchcal, bible, and psalter apps may be spun off as separate projects soon and added as dependencies to this project
