		1 Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly,
		*
	</p>
	<p>
		nor stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of the
		scornful;
	</p>
	<p>
		2 But his delight is in the law of the Lord, *
	</p>
	<p>
		and on his law will he meditate day and night.
	</p>
	<p>
		3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the waterside, *
	</p>
	<p>
		that will bring forth his fruit in due season.
	</p>
	<p>
		4 His leaf also shall not wither; *
	</p>
	<p>
		and look, whatever he does, it shall prosper.
	</p>
	<p>
		5 As for the ungodly, it is not so with them; *
	</p>
	<p>
		but they are like the chaff, which the wind scatters away from the face
		of the earth.
	</p>
	<p>
		6 Therefore the ungodly shall not be able to stand in the judgment, *
	</p>
	<p>
		neither the sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
	</p>
	<p>
		7 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous, *
	</p>
	<p>
		but the way of the ungodly shall perish.

		1 Why do the nations so furiously rage together? *
	</p>
	<p>
		And why do the peoples devise a vain thing?
	</p>
	<p>
		2 The kings of the earth stand up, and the rulers take counsel
		together, *
	</p>
	<p>
		against the Lord and against his Anointed:
	</p>
	<p>
		3 "Let us break their bonds asunder *
	</p>
	<p>
		and cast away their cords from us."
	</p>
	<p>
		4 He who dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn; *
	</p>
	<p>
		the Lord shall hold them in derision.
	</p>
	<p>
		5 Then shall he speak to them in his wrath *
	</p>
	<p>
		and terrify them in his great anger:
	</p>
	<p>
		6 "I myself have set my King *
	</p>
	<p>
		upon my holy hill of Zion."
	</p>
	<p>
		7 I will proclaim the decree of the Lord; *
	</p>
	<p>
		he said to me, "You are my Son; this day have I begotten you.
	</p>
	<p>
		8 Ask of me, and I shall give you the nations for your inheritance *
	</p>
	<p>
		and the ends of the earth for your possession.
	</p>
	<p>
		9 You shall bruise them with a rod of iron *
	</p>
	<p>
		and break them in pieces like a potter's vessel."
	</p>
	<p>
		10 Be wise now, O you kings; *
	</p>
	<p>
		be warned, you judges of the earth.
	</p>
	<p>
		11 Serve the Lord in fear, *
	</p>
	<p>
		and rejoice with trembling.
	</p>
	<p>
		12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way; for his
		wrath is quickly kindled. *
	</p>
	<p>
		Blessed are all those who put their trust in him.

		1 Lord, how they are increased who trouble me; *

	</p>
	<p>
		4 I called upon the Lord with my voice, *
	</p>
	<p>
		and he heard me from his holy hill.
	</p>
	<p>
		5 I lay down and slept, and rose up again, *
	</p>
	<p>

	</p>
	<p>

		you set me free when I was in trouble; have mercy upon me, and hear my

	<p>
		when I call upon the Lord, he will hear me.

		1 Give ear to my words, O Lord; *

	<p>
		consider my meditation.

	<p>
		2 O hearken unto the voice of my calling, my King and my God,*
	</p>
	<p>
		for unto you will I make my prayer.
	</p>
	<p>
		3 My voice shall you hear in the morning, O Lord; *
	</p>
	<p>
		early in the morning will I direct my prayer unto you, and will look
		up.
	</p>
	<p>
		4 For you are not a god who has pleasure in wickedness, *
	</p>
	<p>
		neither shall any evil dwell with you.
	</p>
	<p>
		5 The boastful shall not stand in your sight, *
	</p>
	<p>
		for you hate all those who work iniquity.
	</p>
	<p>
		6 You shall destroy those who speak lies; *
	</p>
	<p>
		the Lord will abhor the bloodthirsty and the deceitful.
	</p>
	<p>
		7 But as for me, through the multitude of your mercies I will come into
		your house, *
	</p>
	<p>
		and in reverence will I bow myself toward your holy temple.
	</p>
	<p>
		8 Lead me, O Lord, in your righteousness, because of my enemies; *
	</p>
	<p>
		make your way straight before my face.
	</p>
	<p>
		9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; *
	</p>
	<p>
		their heart is eaten up with wickedness.
	</p>
	<p>
		10 Their throat is an open sepulcher; *
	</p>
	<p>
		they flatter with their tongue.
	</p>
	<p>
		11 Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall because of their own
		devices; *
	</p>
	<p>
		because of the multitude of their transgressions cast them out, for
		they have rebelled against you.
	</p>
	<p>
		12 But let all those who put their trust in you rejoice; *
	</p>
	<p>
		let them ever give thanks because you defend them; those who love your
		Name shall be joyful in you.
	</p>
	<p>
		13 For you, Lord, will give your blessing unto the righteous, *
	</p>
	<p>
		and with your favorable kindness you will defend him as with a shield.

	5 The voice of the Lord breaks the cedar trees; *

<p>
	indeed, the Lord breaks the cedars of Lebanon.

</p>
<p>
	2 O Lord my God, I cried unto you, *

</p>
<p>
	3 You, Lord, have brought my soul out of the Grave; *
</p>
<p>
	you have saved my life from among those who go down to the Pit.

<p>
	4 Sing praises unto the Lord, O you saints of his, *
</p>

	you, Lord, of your goodness, have made my hill so strong."
</p>
<p>
	7 You turned your face from me, *

<p>
	8 Then I cried unto you, O Lord, *

	and came to my Lord most humbly.
</p>
<p>
	9 What profit is there in my bloodshed, *
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	10 Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; *
</p>
<p>
	my eye is consumed with heaviness, and also my soul and my body.
</p>
<p>

	13 I have become a reproof among all my enemies, but especially among my

<p>
	my acquaintances are afraid of me, and those who see me in the street
	shrink from me.
</p>
<p>
	14 I am utterly forgotten, as a dead man, out of mind; *
</p>
<p>
	I have become like a broken vessel.
</p>
<p>
	15 For I have heard the whispering of the multitude, and fear is on every
	side, *
</p>
<p>
	while they conspire together against me and take their counsel to take away
	my life.
</p>
<p>
	16 But my hope has been in you, O Lord; *
</p>
<p>
	I have said, "You are my God."

	17 My time is in your hand; *

	deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.

	and save me for your mercy's sake.
</p>
<p>
	19 Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon you; *
</p>
<p>
	let the ungodly be put to confusion, and be put to silence in the grave.
</p>
<p>
	20 Let the lying lips be put to silence, *
</p>
<p>
	which cruelly, disdainfully, and despitefully speak against the righteous.
</p>
<p>
	21 Oh, how plentiful is your goodness, which you have laid up for those who
	fear you, *
</p>
<p>
	and which you have prepared for those who put their trust in you, even
	before the children of men!
</p>
<p>
	22 You hide them in the secret place of your presence from those who
	conspire against them; *
</p>
<p>
	you keep them in your refuge from the strife of tongues.
</p>
<p>
	23 Thanks be to the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	for he has shown me marvellously great kindness in a strong city.
</p>
<p>
	24 But when I was afraid, I said in my haste, *
</p>
<p>
	"I am cast out of the sight of your eyes."
</p>
<p>
	25 Nevertheless, you heard the voice of my prayer *
</p>
<p>
	when I cried unto you.
</p>
<p>
	26 O love the Lord, all you his saints, *

<p>

	proud.

	3 Put your trust in the Lord, and do good; *
</p>
<p>
	dwell in the land, and surely you shall be fed.
</p>
<p>
	4 Delight yourself in the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	and he shall give you your heart's desire.
</p>
<p>
	5 Commit your way unto the Lord and put your trust in him, *
</p>
<p>
	and he shall bring it to pass.
</p>
<p>
	6 He shall make your righteousness as clear as the light *
</p>
<p>
	and your just dealing as the noonday.
</p>
<p>
	7 Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for him; *
</p>
<p>
	do not grieve yourself over the one whose way prospers, over the one who
	carries out evil counsels.
</p>
<p>
	8 Refrain from wrath, and let go of anger; *
</p>
<p>
	fret not yourself, lest you be moved to do evil.
</p>
<p>
	9 For evildoers shall be rooted out, *
</p>
<p>
	but those who wait patiently for the Lord, they shall inherit the land.
</p>
<p>
	10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall be clean gone; *
</p>
<p>
	you shall look for their place, and they shall not be there.
</p>
<p>
	11 But the meek-spirited shall possess the land *
</p>
<p>
	and shall be refreshed with an abundance of peace.
</p>
<p>
	12 The ungodly plot against the just *
</p>
<p>
	and gnash at them with their teeth.
</p>
<p>
	13 The Lord shall laugh at them in scorn, *
</p>
<p>
	for he sees that their day is coming.
</p>
<p>
	14 The ungodly have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow *
</p>
<p>
	to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay those who walk aright.
</p>
<p>
	15 Their sword shall go through their own heart, *
</p>
<p>
	and their bow shall be broken.
</p>
<p>
	16 The little that the righteous has *
</p>
<p>
	is better than great riches of the ungodly.
</p>
<p>
	17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken, *
</p>
<p>
	but the Lord upholds the righteous.
</p>
<p>
	18 The Lord knows the days of the godly, *
</p>
<p>
	and their inheritance shall endure for ever.
</p>
<p>
	19 They shall not be confounded in perilous times, *
</p>
<p>
	and in the days of famine they shall have enough.
</p>
<p>
	20 As for the ungodly, they shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall
	be consumed as in a fiery furnace; *
</p>
<p>
	even as smoke shall they vanish away.
</p>
<p>
	21 The ungodly borrow and do not repay, *
</p>
<p>
	but the righteous are merciful and generous.
</p>
<p>
	22 Those who are blessed by God shall possess the land, *
</p>
<p>
	but those who are cursed by him shall be rooted out.
</p>
<p>
	23 The Lord orders a man's steps; *
</p>
<p>
	he makes his footsteps sure and preserves him on his path.
</p>
<p>
	24 Though he fall, he shall not be cast down, *
</p>
<p>
	for the Lord upholds him with his hand.
</p>
<p>
	25 I have been young, and now I am old, *
</p>
<p>
	yet I never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his children begging bread.
</p>
<p>
	26 The righteous is ever merciful in lending, *
</p>
<p>
	and his seed shall be blessed.
</p>
<p>
	27 Flee from evil, and do that which is good, *
</p>
<p>
	and dwell in the land for ever.
</p>
<p>
	28 For the Lord loves that which is right; *
</p>
<p>
	he forsakes not those who are godly, and they are preserved for ever.
</p>
<p>
	29 The unrighteous shall be punished; *
</p>
<p>
	as for the seed of the ungodly, it shall be rooted out.
</p>
<p>
	30 The righteous shall inherit the land *
</p>
<p>
	and dwell therein for ever.
</p>
<p>
	31 The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, *
</p>
<p>
	and his tongue talks of judgment.
</p>
<p>
	32 The law of his God is in his heart, *
</p>
<p>
	and his footsteps shall not falter.
</p>
<p>
	33 The ungodly lie in wait for the righteous *
</p>
<p>
	and seek occasion to slay him.
</p>
<p>
	34 The Lord will not leave him in their hand, *
</p>
<p>
	nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged.
</p>
<p>
	35 Hope in the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt you so that you
	shall possess the land; *
</p>
<p>
	when the ungodly perish, you shall see it.
</p>
<p>
	36 I myself have seen the ungodly in great power, *
</p>
<p>
	and flourishing like a tree in full leaf.
</p>
<p>
	37 I went by, and behold, they were gone; *
</p>
<p>
	I sought them, but their place could nowhere be found.
</p>
<p>
	38 Mark the blameless, and take heed of the upright, *
</p>
<p>
	for there is a future for the peaceable.
</p>
<p>
	39 As for the transgressors, they shall perish together, *
</p>
<p>
	and the end of the ungodly is that they shall be rooted out at the last.
</p>
<p>
	40 But the salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	who is also their strength in the time of trouble.
</p>
<p>
	41 And the Lord shall stand by them and save them; *
</p>
<p>
	he shall deliver them from the ungodly and shall save them, because they
	put their trust in him.

	<em>Domine, ne in furore</em>
</p>
<p>
	1 Rebuke me not, O Lord, in your anger, *
</p>
<p>
	neither chasten me in your weighty displeasure.
</p>
<p>
	2 For your arrows stick fast in me, *
</p>
<p>
	and your hand presses me hard.
</p>
<p>
	3 There is no health in my flesh, because of your displeasure; *
</p>
<p>
	neither is there any rest in my bones, by reason of my sin.
</p>
<p>
	4 For my iniquities have gone over my head *
</p>
<p>
	and are like a heavy burden, too much for me to bear.
</p>
<p>
	5 My wounds stink and fester, *
</p>
<p>
	by reason of my foolishness.
</p>
<p>
	6 I am brought into such great trouble and misery *
</p>
<p>
	that I go about mourning all the day long.
</p>
<p>
	7 For my loins are filled with burning, *
</p>
<p>
	and there is no wholeness in my body.
</p>
<p>
	8 I am feeble and sorely smitten; *
</p>
<p>
	I have roared because of the tumult of my heart.
</p>
<p>
	9 Lord, you know all my desire, *
</p>
<p>
	and my groaning is not hidden from you.
</p>
<p>
	10 My heart is panting, my strength has failed me, *
</p>
<p>
	and the sight of my eyes is gone from me.
</p>
<p>
	11 My friends and my neighbors turn away from my trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	and my kinsmen stand afar off.
</p>
<p>
	12 Those also who seek after my life lay snares for me, *
</p>
<p>
	and those who go about to do me evil talk of wickedness and imagine deceit
	all the day long.
</p>
<p>
	13 As for me, I am like the deaf who do not hear, *
</p>
<p>
	and as one who is mute, who does not open his mouth.
</p>
<p>
	14 I have become like a man who hears not, *
</p>
<p>
	and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
</p>
<p>
	15 For in you, O Lord, have I put my trust; *
</p>
<p>
	you shall answer for me, O Lord my God.
</p>
<p>
	16 I have said, "Let not my enemies triumph over me," *
</p>
<p>
	for when my foot slipped, they rejoiced greatly over me.
</p>
<p>
	17 Truly, I am about to fall, *
</p>
<p>
	and my pain is ever with me.
</p>
<p>
	18 For I will confess my wickedness, *
</p>
<p>
	and be sorry for my sin.
</p>
<p>
	19 But my enemies live, and are mighty, *
</p>
<p>
	and those who hate me wrongfully are many in number.
</p>
<p>
	20 Those also who repay evil for good are against me, *
</p>
<p>
	because I follow that which is good.
</p>
<p>
	21 Forsake me not, O Lord my God; *
</p>
<p>
	O be not far from me.

<p>
	1 I said, "I will take heed to my ways, *

<p>
	that I may not offend with my tongue.
</p>
<p>
	2 I will keep my mouth as with a bridle *
</p>
<p>
	while the ungodly are in my sight."
</p>
<p>
	3 I held my tongue and spoke nothing; *
</p>
<p>
	I kept silence, even from good words; but it was pain and grief to me.
</p>
<p>
	4 My heart was hot within me, and while I was thus pondering the fire
	kindled, *
</p>
<p>
	and at the last I spoke with my tongue:
</p>
<p>
	5 "Lord, let me know my end and the number of my days, *
</p>
<p>
	that I may learn how short my life is.
</p>
<p>
	6 Behold, you have made my days as a span in length, *
</p>
<p>
	and my age is even as nothing before you; and truly, everyone living is but
	a breath.
</p>
<p>
	7 For everyone walks about as a shadow, and disquiets himself in vain; *
</p>
<p>
	he heaps up riches and cannot tell who shall gather them.
</p>
<p>
	8 And now, Lord, what is my hope? *
</p>
<p>
	Truly, my hope is in you.
</p>
<p>
	9 Deliver me from all my offenses, *
</p>
<p>
	and make me not a taunt of the foolish.
</p>
<p>
	10 I became mute and opened not my mouth, *
</p>
<p>
	for it was you that brought it to pass.
</p>
<p>
	11 Take your affliction from me; *
</p>
<p>
	I am consumed by the blows of your heavy hand.
</p>
<p>
	12 When you, with rebukes, chasten someone for sin, you consume what is
	dear to him, like a moth eating a garment; *
</p>
<p>
	everyone therefore is but vanity.
</p>
<p>
	13 Hear my prayer, O Lord, and with your ears consider my cry; *
</p>
<p>
	hold not your peace at my tears.
</p>
<p>
	14 For I am a stranger with you, *
</p>
<p>
	and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
</p>
<p>
	15 O turn your gaze from me, that I may again be glad, *
</p>
<p>
	before I go away to be seen no more."

	<em>Expectans expectavi</em>
</p>
<p>
	1 I waited patiently for the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	and he inclined to me, and heard my call.
</p>
<p>
	2 He brought me out of the horrible pit, out of the mire and clay; *
</p>
<p>
	he set my feet upon the rock, and secured my footing.
</p>
<p>
	3 He has put a new song in my mouth, *
</p>
<p>
	a song of thanksgiving unto our God.
</p>
<p>
	4 Many shall see and fear, *
</p>
<p>
	and shall put their trust in the Lord.
</p>
<p>
	5 Blessed is the man who has set his hope in the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	and has not turned to the proud, or to those who go about lying.
</p>
<p>
	6 O Lord my God, great are the wondrous works which you have done, and also
	your thoughts toward us; *
</p>
<p>
	there is none who can be compared with you.
</p>
<p>
	7 If I should declare them and speak of them, *
</p>
<p>
	they would be more than I am able to express.
</p>
<p>
	8 Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, *
</p>
<p>
	but my ears you have opened.
</p>
<p>
	9 Burnt offerings and sin offerings you have not required, *
</p>

	will, O my God; *
</p>
<p>
	indeed, your law is within my heart."

	11 I have declared your righteousness in the great congregation; *

<p>
	behold, I will not restrain my lips, O Lord, and that you know.
</p>
<p>
	12 I have not hidden your righteousness within my heart; *
</p>
<p>
	my talk has been of your truth and of your salvation.
</p>
<p>
	13 I have not concealed your loving mercy and truth *
</p>
<p>
	from the great congregation.
</p>
<p>
	14 Withdraw not your mercy from me, O Lord; *
</p>
<p>
	let your loving-kindness and your truth always preserve me.
</p>
<p>
	15 For innumerable troubles have encompassed me; my sins have taken such
	hold of me that I am not able to look up; *
</p>
<p>
	indeed, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart has
	utterly failed me.
</p>
<p>
	16 O Lord, let it be your pleasure to deliver me; *
</p>
<p>
	make haste, O Lord, to help me.
</p>
<p>
	17 Let them be ashamed and confounded who seek after my soul to destroy it;
	*
</p>
<p>
	let them be driven backward and rebuked who wish me evil.
</p>
<p>
	18 Let them be desolate and rewarded with shame *
</p>
<p>
	who say to me, "Aha, Aha."
</p>
<p>
	19 Let all those who seek you be joyful and glad in you; *
</p>
<p>
	and let those who love your salvation say always, "The Lord be praised."
</p>
<p>
	20 As for me, I am poor and needy, *
</p>
<p>
	but the Lord cares for me.
</p>
<p>
	21 You are my helper and deliverer; *
</p>
<p>
	do not tarry, O my God.

	24 Why do you hide your face *

<p>
	and forget our misery and trouble?

<p>
	25 For our soul is brought low, even to the dust; *

</p>
<p>
	5 Fearfulness and trembling have come upon me, *
</p>
<p>
	and a horrible dread has overwhelmed me.
</p>
<p>
	6 And I said, "Oh, that I had wings like a dove, *

<p>
	trouble and sorrow are in the midst of her.
</p>
<p>

<p>
	deceit and guile do not leave her streets.

	13 Neither was it my adversary who exalted himself against me, *

<p>
	my comrade and my own familiar friend.
</p>
<p>
	15 We took sweet counsel together *

<p>
	and walked in the house of God as friends.
</p>
<p>
	16 Let death come hastily upon them, and let them go down alive into the
	grave, *
</p>
<p>
	for there is wickedness in their hearts.
</p>

	17 As for me, I will call upon God, *

</p>
<p>
	20 God, who endures for ever, shall hear me and bring them down; *
</p>
<p>
	for they never change, nor do they fear God.
</p>
<p>
	21 My familiar friend has laid his hands upon those who were at peace with
	him, *
</p>
<p>
	and he has broken his covenant.
</p>
<p>
	22 The words of his mouth were softer than butter, yet war was in his
	heart; *
</p>
<p>
	his words were smoother than oil, and yet they were drawn swords.

<p>
	23 O cast your burden upon the Lord, and he shall nourish you, *

<p>
	you, O God, shall bring them into the pit of destruction.

	1 Save me, O God, *

<p>
	for the waters have come up even to my neck.

	2 I sink down in the deep mire, where there is no ground; *
</p>
<p>
	I have come into deep waters, so that the floods run over me.
</p>
<p>
	3 I am weary of crying; my throat is dry; *
</p>
<p>
	my sight fails me from waiting so long for my God.
</p>
<p>
	4 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; *
</p>
<p>
	those who are my enemies, and would destroy me wrongfully, are mighty.
</p>
<p>
	5 They bid me restore things I never took. *

	O God, you know my foolishness, and my faults are not hidden from you.
</p>
<p>
	6 Let not those who trust in you, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed because
	of me; *
</p>
<p>
	let not those who seek you be confounded through me, O God of Israel.
</p>

	7 Surely for your sake have I suffered reproach; *
</p>
<p>
	shame has covered my face.
</p>
<p>
	8 I have become a stranger to my brethren, *
</p>
<p>
	unknown to my mother's children,
</p>
<p>
	9 Because zeal for your house has consumed me, *
</p>
<p>
	and the reproaches of those who reproached you have fallen upon me.
</p>
<p>
	10 I wept, and humbled myself with fasting, *
</p>
<p>
	but that was turned to my reproach.
</p>
<p>
	11 I put on sackcloth also, *
</p>
<p>
	and I became a byword among them.

	12 Those who sit in the gate speak against me, *
</p>
<p>
	and the drunkards make songs about me.
</p>
<p>
	13 But, Lord, I make my prayer to you *
</p>
<p>
	in an acceptable time.
</p>
<p>
	14 Hear me, O God, in the multitude of your mercy, *
</p>
<p>
	even in the truth of your salvation.
</p>
<p>
	15 Take me out of the mire, lest I sink; *
</p>
<p>
	O let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of the deep waters.
</p>
<p>
	16 Let not the floodwaters drown me, neither let the deep swallow me up, *
</p>
<p>
	and let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.

	17 Hear me, O Lord, for your loving-kindness is good; *

<p>
	turn to me according to the multitude of your mercies;

<p>
	19 Draw near to me and save me; *
</p>

	O deliver me because of my enemies.
</p>
<p>
	20 You have known my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor; *
</p>
<p>
	my adversaries are all in your sight.
</p>
<p>
	21 Reproach has broken my heart; I am full of heaviness; *
</p>
<p>
	I looked for some to have pity on me, but there was no one, neither have I
	found any to comfort me.
</p>
<p>
	22 They gave me gall to eat, *
</p>
<p>
	and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.
</p>
<p>
	23 Let their table become a snare for them, *
</p>
<p>
	and let their prosperity become a trap for them.
</p>
<p>
	24 Let their eyes be blinded, that they may not see, *
</p>
<p>
	and make their loins tremble continually.
</p>
<p>
	25 Pour out your indignation upon them, *
</p>
<p>
	and let your wrathful displeasure overtake them.
</p>
<p>
	26 Let their habitation be desolate, *
</p>
<p>
	and let no one dwell in their tents.
</p>
<p>
	27 For they persecute him whom you have stricken, *
</p>
<p>
	and they talk of the pain of those you have wounded.
</p>
<p>
	28 Lay to their charge guilt upon guilt, *
</p>
<p>
	and let them not receive your vindication.
</p>
<p>
	29 Let them be wiped out of the book of the living, *
</p>
<p>
	and not be written among the righteous.
</p>
<p>
	30 As for me, when I am poor and in pain, *
</p>
<p>
	your help, O God, shall lift me up.
</p>
<p>
	31 I will praise the Name of God with a song, *

	<em>Quam bonus Isr&#230;l!</em>
</p>
<p>
	1 Truly, God is loving to Israel, *
</p>
<p>
	even to those who have a clean heart.
</p>
<p>
	2 Nevertheless, my feet had almost stumbled; *
</p>
<p>
	my steps had nearly slipped.
</p>
<p>
	3 For I was envious of the proud *
</p>
<p>
	when I saw the ungodly in such prosperity.
</p>
<p>
	4 For they are in no fear of death, *
</p>
<p>
	but their bodies are healthy and strong.
</p>
<p>
	5 They come to no misfortune like other folk, *
</p>
<p>
	neither are they afflicted like others.
</p>
<p>
	6 Therefore they wear pride as a necklace, *
</p>
<p>
	and they wrap themselves with violence as with a garment.
</p>
<p>
	7 Their eyes swell with greed, *
</p>
<p>
	and their hearts overflow with wicked thoughts.
</p>
<p>
	8 Their talk is malice and mockery; *
</p>
<p>
	they have proud looks, and tyrannous words are on their lips.
</p>
<p>
	9 For they set their mouth against the heavens, *
</p>
<p>
	and their evil speech spreads through the world.
</p>
<p>
	10 Therefore the people turn to them, *
</p>
<p>
	and find no fault in them.
</p>
<p>
	11 They say, "How should God perceive it? *
</p>
<p>
	Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
</p>
<p>
	12 Behold, these are the ungodly; *
</p>
<p>
	they prosper in their ways, and they have riches in possession.
</p>
<p>
	13 I said, "Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart *
</p>
<p>
	and washed my hands in innocence."
</p>
<p>
	14 All the day long have I been afflicted, *
</p>
<p>
	and chastened every morning.
</p>
<p>
	15 Indeed, had I spoken as they do, *
</p>
<p>
	then would I have betrayed the generation of your children.
</p>
<p>
	16 When I sought to understand this, *
</p>
<p>
	it was too hard for me,
</p>
<p>
	17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; *
</p>
<p>
	then I understood their end.
</p>
<p>
	18 Surely, you set them in slippery places, *
</p>
<p>
	and cast them down, and destroy them.
</p>
<p>
	19 Oh, how suddenly are they consumed; *
</p>
<p>
	they perish and come to a fearful end.
</p>
<p>
	20 Indeed, like a dream when one awakens, *
</p>
<p>
	so shall you make their image vanish out of the city.
</p>
<p>
	21 Thus my heart was grieved, *
</p>
<p>
	and I was wounded within;
</p>
<p>
	22 So foolish was I, and ignorant, *
</p>
<p>
	as if I were a beast before you.
</p>
<p>
	23 Nevertheless, I am always with you, *
</p>
<p>
	for you hold me by my right hand.
</p>
<p>
	24 You shall guide me with your counsel, *
</p>
<p>
	and after that receive me with glory.
</p>
<p>
	25 Whom have I in heaven but you? *
</p>
<p>
	And there is no one on earth whom I desire in comparison with you.
</p>
<p>
	26 Though my flesh and my heart fail me, *
</p>
<p>
	God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
</p>
<p>
	27 For behold, those who forsake you shall perish; *
</p>
<p>
	you destroy all those who are unfaithful to you.
</p>
<p>
	28 But it is good for me to hold fast to God, to put my trust in the Lord
	God, *
</p>
<p>
	and to speak of all your works in the gates of the city of Zion.

	<em>Ut quid, Deus?</em>
</p>
<p>
	1 O God, why have you utterly cast us off? *
</p>
<p>
	Why is your wrath so hot against the sheep of your pasture?
</p>
<p>
	2 O think upon your congregation *
</p>
<p>
	whom you have purchased and redeemed of old.
</p>
<p>
	3 Think upon the tribe of your inheritance, *
</p>
<p>
	and Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.
</p>
<p>
	4 Draw near and behold how all is made desolate *
</p>
<p>
	and how the enemy has destroyed all that is in your sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
	5 Your adversaries roar in the midst of your holy place *
</p>
<p>
	and set up their banners as tokens of victory.
</p>
<p>
	6 Like hewers of timber in a thicket of trees, *
</p>
<p>
	so have they broken down all the carved work with axes and hammers.
</p>
<p>
	7 They have set fire to your holy place *
</p>
<p>
	and have defiled the dwelling place of your Name, even to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	8 They said in their hearts, "Let us make havoc of them altogether." *
</p>
<p>
	Thus have they burnt up all the houses of God in the land.
</p>
<p>
	9 We do not see any signs; there is not one prophet anymore; *
</p>
<p>
	there is no one who knows how long these things shall continue.
</p>
<p>
	10 O God, how long shall the adversary do this dishonor? *
</p>
<p>
	How long shall the enemy blaspheme your Name, for ever?
</p>
<p>
	11 Why do you withdraw your hand? *
</p>
<p>
	Why do you not take your right hand out of your bosom to consume the enemy?
</p>
<p>
	12 For God is my King of old; *
</p>
<p>
	he is the one bringing help upon the earth.
</p>
<p>
	13 You divided the sea through your power; *
</p>
<p>
	you broke the heads of the dragons in the waters.
</p>
<p>
	14 You smote the heads of Leviathan in pieces *
</p>
<p>
	and gave him to be food for the people in the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
	15 You brought fountains and waters out of the hard rocks, *
</p>
<p>
	and you dried up mighty waters.
</p>
<p>
	16 The day is yours, and the night is yours; *
</p>
<p>
	you have prepared the light and the sun.
</p>
<p>
	17 You have set all the borders of the earth; *
</p>
<p>
	you have made summer and winter.
</p>
<p>
	18 Remember this, O Lord, how the enemy scoffed, *
</p>
<p>
	and how the foolish people have blasphemed your Name.
</p>
<p>
	19 Deliver not the soul of your turtledove to the wild beasts, *
</p>
<p>
	and forget not for ever the lives of your poor.
</p>
<p>
	20 Look upon your covenant, *
</p>
<p>
	for the dark places of the earth are full of violence.
</p>
<p>
	21 Let not the oppressed go away ashamed, *
</p>
<p>
	but let the poor and needy give praise to your Name.
</p>
<p>
	22 Arise, O God, maintain your own cause; *
</p>
<p>
	remember how the foolish one blasphemes you daily.
</p>
<p>
	23 Forget not the voice of your enemies, *
</p>
<p>
	nor the tumult of those who hate you, which increases ever more and more.

<p>
	1 Hear my teaching, O my people; *
</p>
<p>
	incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
</p>
<p>
	2 I will open my mouth in a parable; *
</p>
<p>
	I will utter dark sayings of old,

<p>
	3 Which we have heard and known, *

	4 That we should not hide them from the children of the generations to
	come, *
</p>
<p>
	but show the honor of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he has
	done.
</p>
<p>
	5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Israel a law, *
</p>
<p>
	which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children,
</p>
<p>
	6 That their posterity might know it, *
</p>
<p>
	and the children which were yet unborn;
</p>
<p>
	7 With the intent that when they came up *
</p>
<p>
	they might show it to their children,

<p>
	8 That they might put their trust in God, *
</p>
<p>
	and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments;

<p>
	9 And not be as their forefathers, a faithless and stubborn generation, *
</p>
<p>
	a generation that did not set their heart aright, and whose spirit did not
	cleave steadfastly to God,
</p>
<p>
	10 Like the children of Ephraim, archers carrying bows, *
</p>
<p>
	who turned back in the day of battle.
</p>
<p>
	11 They did not keep the covenant of God, *
</p>
<p>
	and would not walk in his law,
</p>
<p>
	12 But forgot what he had done, *
</p>
<p>
	and the wonderful works that he had shown them.
</p>
<p>
	13 Marvelous things he did in the sight of our forefathers, *
</p>
<p>
	in the land of Egypt, even in the field of Zoan.
</p>
<p>
	14 He divided the sea and let them go through; *
</p>
<p>
	he made the waters to stand in a heap.
</p>
<p>
	15 In the daytime he led them with a cloud, *
</p>
<p>
	and all the night through with a light of fire.
</p>
<p>
	16 He split the hard rocks in the wilderness *
</p>
<p>
	and gave them drink in abundance, as out of the great deep.
</p>
<p>
	17 He brought waters out of the stony rock, *
</p>
<p>
	so that it gushed out like the rivers.
</p>
<p>
	18 Yet for all this they sinned more against him, *
</p>
<p>
	and provoked the Most High in the wilderness.
</p>
<p>
	19 They tested God in their hearts *
</p>
<p>
	and demanded food for their craving.
</p>
<p>
	20 They spoke against God, saying, *
</p>
<p>
	"Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?
</p>
<p>
	21 Indeed, he smote the stony rock, so that water gushed out, and the
	streams overflowed; *
</p>
<p>
	but can he give bread also, or provide meat for his people?"
</p>
<p>
	22 When the Lord heard this, he was full of wrath; *
</p>
<p>
	so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and there flared up fierce anger
	against Israel,
</p>
<p>
	23 Because they did not believe in God, *
</p>
<p>
	and did not put their trust in his help.
</p>
<p>
	24 So he commanded the clouds above *
</p>
<p>
	and opened the doors of heaven.
</p>
<p>
	25 He rained down manna upon them to eat *
</p>
<p>
	and gave them food from heaven.
</p>
<p>
	26 So mortals ate the bread of angels; *
</p>
<p>
	for he sent them food enough.
</p>
<p>
	27 He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens, *
</p>
<p>
	and through his power he brought in the south wind.
</p>
<p>
	28 He rained meat upon them as thick as dust *
</p>
<p>
	and feathered fowl like the sand of the sea.
</p>
<p>
	29 He let it fall among their tents, *
</p>
<p>
	even round about their habitations.
</p>
<p>
	30 So they ate and were well filled, for he gave them what they desired; *
</p>
<p>
	they did not deny themselves their cravings,
</p>
<p>
	31 But while the food was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came
	upon them, and slew the mightiest of them, *
</p>
<p>
	and struck down the young men of Israel.
</p>
<p>
	32 But for all this they sinned yet more, *
</p>
<p>
	and did not believe his wondrous works.
</p>
<p>
	33 Therefore he brought their days to an end in vanity *
</p>
<p>
	and their years in trouble.
</p>
<p>
	34 When he slew them, they sought him, *
</p>
<p>
	and returned, and inquired after God.
</p>
<p>
	35 And they remembered that God was their rock, *
</p>
<p>
	and the Most High God was their redeemer.
</p>
<p>
	36 Nevertheless, they flattered him with their mouth *
</p>
<p>
	and spoke deceitfully to him with their tongue.
</p>
<p>
	37 For their heart was not fixed on him, *
</p>
<p>
	neither did they continue steadfast in his covenant.
</p>
<p>
	38 But he was so merciful that he forgave their iniquities *
</p>
<p>
	and did not destroy them.
</p>
<p>
	39 Indeed, many times he turned his wrath away *
</p>
<p>
	and would not permit his displeasure to arise.
</p>
<p>
	40 For he considered that they were but flesh, *
</p>
<p>
	that they were even as the wind that passes away and comes not again.
</p>
<p>
	41 Many times they provoked him in the wilderness *
</p>
<p>
	and grieved him in the desert.
</p>
<p>
	42 They turned back, and tested God, *
</p>
<p>
	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
</p>
<p>
	43 They remembered not his power, *
</p>
<p>
	nor the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy,
</p>
<p>
	44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt *
</p>
<p>
	and his wonders in the field of Zoan.
</p>
<p>
	45 He turned their waters into blood, *
</p>
<p>
	so that they might not drink of the rivers.
</p>
<p>
	46 He sent flies among them, which devoured them up, *
</p>
<p>
	and frogs to destroy them.
</p>
<p>
	47 He gave their fruit to the grasshopper *
</p>
<p>
	and their labor to the locust.
</p>
<p>
	48 He destroyed their vines with hailstones *
</p>
<p>
	and their sycamore trees with the frost.
</p>
<p>
	49 He smote their cattle also with hailstones *
</p>
<p>
	and their flocks with hot thunderbolts.
</p>
<p>
	50 He cast upon them the furiousness of his wrath, anger, displeasure, and
	trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	sending these destroying angels among them.
</p>
<p>
	51 He made a way for his indignation, and did not spare their soul from
	death, *
</p>
<p>
	but gave their life over to the pestilence,
</p>
<p>
	52 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt, *
</p>
<p>
	the firstfruits of their strength in the dwellings of Ham.
</p>
<p>
	53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like sheep *
</p>
<p>
	and carried them in the wilderness like a flock.
</p>
<p>
	54 He brought them out safely, and they were not afraid; *
</p>
<p>
	he overwhelmed their enemies with the sea,
</p>
<p>
	55 And brought them within the borders of his holy land, *
</p>
<p>
	to his mountain which he obtained with his right hand.
</p>
<p>
	56 He cast out the nations before them, *
</p>
<p>
	and caused their land to be divided among them for an inheritance, and made
	the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
</p>
<p>
	57 But they tested and displeased the Most High God, *
</p>
<p>
	and did not keep his testimonies,
</p>
<p>
	58 But turned their backs and fell away like their forefathers, *
</p>
<p>
	twisting aside like a broken bow.
</p>
<p>
	59 For they grieved him with their hill altars *
</p>
<p>
	and provoked him to displeasure with their images.
</p>
<p>
	60 When God heard this, he was full of wrath *
</p>
<p>
	and utterly rejected Israel,
</p>
<p>
	61 So that he forsook the tabernacle in Shiloh, *
</p>
<p>
	even the tent that he had pitched among them.
</p>
<p>
	62 He delivered the ark into captivity, *
</p>
<p>
	and his glory into the enemy's hand.
</p>
<p>
	63 He gave his people over to the sword *
</p>
<p>
	and was angry with his inheritance.
</p>
<p>
	64 Fire consumed their young men, *
</p>
<p>
	and their maidens had no marriage songs.
</p>
<p>
	65 Their priests were slain with the sword, *
</p>
<p>
	and their widows made no lamentation.
</p>
<p>
	66 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, *
</p>
<p>
	and like a warrior recovered from wine.
</p>
<p>
	67 He drove his enemies backward *
</p>
<p>
	and put them to a perpetual shame.
</p>
<p>
	68 He rejected the tabernacle of Joseph *
</p>
<p>
	and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,
</p>
<p>
	69 But chose the tribe of Judah, *
</p>
<p>
	even the hill of Zion which he loved.
</p>
<p>
	70 And there he built his sanctuary, like the heights of heaven, *
</p>
<p>
	like the earth which he had established for ever.
</p>
<p>
	71 He chose David his servant, *
</p>
<p>
	and took him away from the sheepfolds;
</p>
<p>
	72 As he was following the ewes that were great with young, God took him, *
</p>
<p>
	that he might feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
</p>
<p>
	73 So he fed them with a faithful and true heart, *
</p>
<p>
	and guided them with skillful hands.

	1 O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; *

<p>
	6 Pour out your indignation upon the nations that have not known you, *
</p>
<p>
	and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon your Name.
</p>

	7 For they have devoured Jacob *

	to die.

</p>
<p>
	repay them, O Lord, seven-fold into their bosoms.
</p>

	let them perish at the rebuke of your countenance.

	13 Oh, that my people would have hearkened unto me, *

	14 I would soon have put down their enemies *

<p>
	15 The haters of the Lord would humble themselves before him, *

<p>
	and I have become as one who has no strength.
</p>
<p>
	4 I have become like the dead, and like the slain who lie in the grave, *
</p>
<p>
	whom you remember no more, and who are cut off from your hand.
</p>
<p>
	5 You have laid me in the lowest pit, *
</p>
<p>
	in a place of darkness, and in the deep.
</p>
<p>
	6 Your indignation lies heavy upon me, *
</p>
<p>
	and you have overwhelmed me with all your storms.
</p>
<p>
	7 You have put my friends far from me, *
</p>
<p>
	and made me to be abhorred by them.
</p>
<p>
	8 I am in prison; *
</p>
<p>
	I cannot go forth.
</p>
<p>
	9 My sight fails because of trouble; *
</p>
<p>
	Lord, I have called daily upon you; I have stretched forth my hands unto
	you.
</p>
<p>
	10 Do you show wonders among the dead, *
</p>
<p>
	or shall the dead rise up again and praise you?
</p>
<p>
	11 Shall your loving-kindness be shown in the grave, *
</p>
<p>
	or your faithfulness in destruction?
</p>
<p>
	12 Shall your wondrous works be known in the dark, *
</p>
<p>
	and your righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?
</p>
<p>
	13 Unto you have I cried, O Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	and early shall my prayer come before you.
</p>
<p>
	14 Lord, why do you cast off my soul *
</p>
<p>
	and hide your face from me?
</p>
<p>
	15 I am in misery, like one who is at the point of death; *
</p>
<p>
	even from my youth, your terrors have I suffered with a troubled mind.
</p>
<p>
	16 Your wrathful displeasure goes over me, *
</p>
<p>
	and the fear of you has undone me.
</p>
<p>
	17 Daily they come round about me like water, *
</p>
<p>
	and encompass me on every side.
</p>
<p>
	18 My companions and neighbors you have put away from me, *
</p>
<p>
	and hidden my friends out of my sight.

<p>
	with my mouth will I ever be proclaiming your faithfulness, from one
	generation to another.
</p>
<p>
	2 For I have said, "Mercy shall be built up for ever; *

</p>
<p>
	3 I have made a covenant with my chosen one; *

	I have sworn to David my servant:

<p>
	4 "Your seed will I establish for ever, *
</p>

	and set up your throne from one generation to another."
</p>
<p>
	5 O Lord, the heavens will praise your wondrous works *

<p>
	6 For who in the clouds can be compared unto the Lord? *
</p>
<p>
	And who among the gods is like unto the Lord?
</p>
<p>
	7 God is greatly to be feared in the council of the saints, *

</p>
<p>
	8 O Lord God of hosts, who is like you? *
</p>
<p>
	Your faithfulness, most mighty Lord, is round about you.
</p>
<p>
	9 You rule the raging of the sea; *
</p>
<p>
	you still the waves when they arise.
</p>
<p>
	10 You have subdued Rahab of the deep, and destroyed her; *
</p>
<p>
	you have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
</p>
<p>
	11 The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours; *
</p>
<p>
	you laid the foundation of the world, and all that is in it.
</p>
<p>
	12 You have made the north and the south; *
</p>
<p>
	Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in your Name.
</p>
<p>
	13 You have a mighty arm; *
</p>
<p>
	strong is your hand, and high is your right hand.
</p>
<p>
	14 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne; *
</p>
<p>
	mercy and truth shall go before your face.
</p>
<p>
	15 Blessed are the people, O Lord, who rejoice in you; *
</p>
<p>
	they shall walk in the light of your countenance.
</p>
<p>
	16 Their delight shall be in your Name all the day long, *
</p>
<p>
	and in your righteousness shall they make their boast.
</p>
<p>
	17 For you are the glory of their strength, *
</p>
<p>
	and by your favor you shall lift up our might.
</p>
<p>
	18 For the Lord is our defense; *
</p>
<p>
	the Holy One of Israel is our King.
</p>
<p>
	19 You spoke in a vision to your saints, and said, *
</p>
<p>
	"I have set the crown upon one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out
	of the people.
</p>
<p>
	20 I have found David my servant; *
</p>
<p>
	with my holy oil have I anointed him.
</p>
<p>
	21 My hand shall hold him fast, *
</p>
<p>
	and my arm shall strengthen him.
</p>
<p>
	22 The enemy shall not be able to do him violence; *
</p>
<p>
	the son of wickedness shall not hurt him.
</p>
<p>
	23 I will smite his foes before his face *
</p>
<p>
	and strike down those who hate him.
</p>
<p>
	24 My faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him, *
</p>
<p>
	and in my Name shall his horn be exalted.
</p>
<p>
	25 I will give him dominion over the sea, *
</p>
<p>
	and with his right hand shall he rule the rivers.
</p>
<p>
	26 He shall say to me, "You are my Father, *
</p>
<p>
	my God, and the rock of my salvation."
</p>
<p>
	27 And I will make him my firstborn, *
</p>
<p>
	higher than the kings of the earth.
</p>
<p>
	28 My mercy will I keep for him for ever, *
</p>
<p>
	and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
</p>
<p>
	29 His seed will I make to endure for ever *
</p>
<p>
	and his throne as the days of heaven.
</p>
<p>
	30 But if his children forsake my law, *
</p>
<p>
	and do not walk in my judgments,
</p>
<p>
	31 If they break my statutes and do not keep my commandments,*
</p>
<p>
	I will punish their offenses with the rod, and their sin with scourges.
</p>
<p>
	32 Nevertheless, my loving-kindness I will not utterly take from him, *
</p>
<p>
	nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
</p>
<p>
	33 My covenant I will not break, *
</p>
<p>
	nor alter the word that has gone out of my lips.
</p>
<p>
	34 I have sworn once by my holiness *
</p>
<p>
	that I will not fail David.
</p>
<p>
	35 His seed shall endure for ever *
</p>
<p>
	and his throne as the sun before me.
</p>
<p>
	36 It shall endure for evermore as the moon, *
</p>
<p>
	and as the faithful witness in the heavens.
</p>
<p>
	37 But you have rejected and forsaken your Anointed; *
</p>
<p>
	you are full of wrath against him.
</p>
<p>
	38 You have broken the covenant with your servant; *
</p>
<p>
	you have defiled his crown and cast it to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	39 You have overthrown all his walls *
</p>
<p>
	and broken down his strongholds.
</p>
<p>
	40 All those who go by plunder him, *
</p>
<p>
	and he has become a reproach to his neighbors.
</p>
<p>
	41 You have exalted the right hand of his enemies, *
</p>
<p>
	and made all his adversaries rejoice.
</p>
<p>
	42 You have turned back the edge of his sword *
</p>
<p>
	and have not given him victory in the battle.
</p>
<p>
	43 You have taken away his glory *
</p>
<p>
	and cast his throne down to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	44 The days of his youth you have shortened *
</p>
<p>
	and covered him with dishonor.
</p>
<p>
	45 Lord, how long will you utterly hide yourself? *
</p>
<p>
	How long shall your wrath burn like fire?
</p>
<p>
	46 O remember how short my time is; *
</p>
<p>
	why have you made all people for nought?
</p>
<p>
	47 What man is there who lives and shall not see death, *
</p>
<p>
	and shall deliver his soul from the power of the Grave?
</p>
<p>
	48 Lord, where are your loving-kindnesses of old, *
</p>
<p>
	which you swore to David in your faithfulness?
</p>
<p>
	49 Remember, Lord, how your servants are reproached, *
</p>
<p>
	and how I bear in my bosom the rebukes of many people;
</p>
<p>
	50 Remember how your enemies have reproached you, O Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	how they have called after your Anointed King with cries of scorn.

	you say, "Return, O children of men."
</p>
<p>
	4 For a thousand years in your sight are as yesterday, *

<p>
	5 You scatter them as a night-watch that comes quickly to an end; *

<p>
	6 They are like the grass, which in the morning is green, *

<p>
	7 For we consume away in your displeasure *

<p>
	8 You have set our misdeeds before you, *

</p>
<p>
	13 Turn again, O Lord, and tarry not; *
</p>
<p>
	be gracious unto your servants.
</p>
<p>
	14 O satisfy us with your mercy in the morning; *
</p>
<p>
	so shall we rejoice and be glad all the days of our life.
</p>
<p>
	15 Comfort us again, according to the measure of the days that you have
	afflicted us, *

<p>
	and for the years in which we have suffered adversity.

<p>
	let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice.
</p>
<p>
	4 Seek the Lord and his strength; *
</p>
<p>
	seek his face evermore.
</p>
<p>
	5 Remember the marvelous works that he has done, *
</p>
<p>
	his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
</p>
<p>
	6 O seed of Abraham his servant, *
</p>
<p>
	O children of Jacob his chosen.
</p>
<p>
	7 He is the Lord our God; *
</p>
<p>
	his judgments are in all the world.
</p>
<p>
	8 He has always been mindful of his covenant, *
</p>
<p>
	and the promise that he made to a thousand generations,
</p>
<p>
	9 Even the covenant that he made with Abraham, *
</p>
<p>
	and the oath that he swore to Isaac,
</p>
<p>
	10 Which he appointed to Jacob for a law, *
</p>
<p>
	and to Israel for an everlasting testament,
</p>
<p>
	11 Saying, "To you will I give the land of Canaan *
</p>
<p>
	to be the portion of your inheritance."
</p>
<p>
	12 When there were yet but a few of them, *
</p>
<p>
	and they were strangers in the land,
</p>
<p>
	13 And they wandered from nation to nation, *
</p>
<p>
	and from one kingdom to another,
</p>
<p>
	14 He allowed no one to do them wrong, *
</p>
<p>
	but reproved even kings for their sakes:
</p>
<p>
	15 "Do not touch my Anointed, *
</p>
<p>
	and do my prophets no harm."
</p>
<p>
	16 Moreover, he called for a famine in the land *
</p>
<p>
	and destroyed all the provision of bread.
</p>
<p>
	17 But he had sent a man before them: *
</p>
<p>
	Joseph, who was sold to be a bondservant,
</p>
<p>
	18 Whose feet they hurt in the stocks; *
</p>
<p>
	they put an iron collar around his neck.
</p>
<p>
	19 Until the time came that his sayings were fulfilled, *
</p>
<p>
	the word of the Lord tried him.
</p>
<p>
	20 The king sent and delivered him; *
</p>
<p>
	the ruler of the people let him go free.
</p>
<p>
	21 He made him lord over his house, *
</p>
<p>
	and ruler of all his possessions,
</p>
<p>
	22 That he might instruct his princes according to his will *
</p>
<p>
	and teach his elders wisdom.
</p>
<p>
	23 Israel also came into Egypt, *
</p>
<p>
	and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
</p>
<p>
	24 And he increased his people exceedingly, *
</p>
<p>
	and made them stronger than their enemies,
</p>
<p>
	25 Whose heart he turned, so that they hated his people, *
</p>
<p>
	and dealt deceitfully with his servants.
</p>
<p>
	26 Then he sent Moses his servant, *
</p>
<p>
	and Aaron whom he had chosen,
</p>
<p>
	27 And they worked his signs among them, *
</p>
<p>
	and wonders in the land of Ham.
</p>
<p>
	28 He sent darkness, and it was dark; *
</p>
<p>
	but they were not obedient to his word.
</p>
<p>
	29 He turned their waters into blood *
</p>
<p>
	and caused their fish to die.
</p>
<p>
	30 Their land brought forth frogs, *
</p>
<p>
	even in their kings' chambers.
</p>
<p>
	31 He spoke the word, and there came all manner of flies, *
</p>
<p>
	and gnats in all their borders.
</p>
<p>
	32 He gave them hailstones for rain, *
</p>
<p>
	and flames of fire in their land.
</p>
<p>
	33 He smote their vines also, and their fig trees, *
</p>
<p>
	and destroyed the trees that were in their borders.
</p>
<p>
	34 He spoke the word, and the grasshoppers came, and locusts innumerable, *
</p>
<p>
	which ate up all the grass in their land and devoured the fruit of their
	ground.
</p>
<p>
	35 He smote all the firstborn in their land, *
</p>
<p>
	even the firstfruits of all their strength.
</p>
<p>
	36 He brought forth Israel with silver and gold; *
</p>
<p>
	in all their tribes there was not one who stumbled.
</p>
<p>
	37 Egypt was glad at their departing, *
</p>
<p>
	for they were afraid of them.
</p>
<p>
	38 He spread out a cloud to be a covering, *
</p>
<p>
	and fire to give light in the night season.
</p>
<p>
	39 At their desire he brought quail, *
</p>
<p>
	and he filled them with the bread of heaven.
</p>
<p>
	40 He opened the rock, and the waters flowed out, *
</p>
<p>
	so that rivers ran in the dry places.
</p>
<p>
	41 For he remembered his holy promise *
</p>
<p>
	and Abraham his servant.
</p>
<p>
	42 And he brought forth his people with joy, *
</p>
<p>
	and his chosen ones with gladness,
</p>
<p>
	43 And gave them the lands of the nations, *
</p>
<p>
	and they took the labors of the peoples in possession,
</p>
<p>
	44 That they might keep his statutes *
</p>
<p>
	and observe his laws. Praise the Lord.

</p>
<p>
	1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, *
</p>
<p>
	and his mercy endures for ever.
</p>
<p>
	2 Who can express the mighty acts of the Lord, *
</p>
<p>
	or show forth all his praise?
</p>
<p>
	3 Blessed are those who act with justice, *
</p>
<p>
	and who always do righteousness.
</p>
<p>
	4 Remember me, O Lord, according to the favor that you show to your people;
	*
</p>
<p>
	O visit me with your salvation,
</p>
<p>
	5 That I may see the felicity of your chosen, *
</p>
<p>
	and rejoice in the gladness of your people, and give thanks with your
	inheritance.
</p>
<p>
	6 We have sinned like our fathers; *
</p>
<p>
	we have done wrong and dealt wickedly.
</p>
<p>
	7 Our fathers regarded not your wonders in Egypt, neither did they keep
	your great goodness in remembrance, *
</p>
<p>
	but were disobedient at the sea, even at the Red Sea.
</p>
<p>
	8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his Name's sake, *
</p>
<p>
	that he might make his power known.
</p>
<p>
	9 He rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; *
</p>
<p>
	so he led them through the deep as through a wilderness.
</p>
<p>
	10 And he saved them from the adversary's hand, *
</p>
<p>
	and delivered them from the hand of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
	11 As for those who troubled them, the waters overwhelmed them;*
</p>
<p>
	there was not one of them left.
</p>
<p>
	12 Then they believed his words *
</p>
<p>
	and sang praises unto him.
</p>
<p>
	13 But soon they forgot his works *
</p>
<p>
	and would not wait for his counsel.
</p>
<p>
	14 A craving came upon them in the wilderness, *
</p>
<p>
	and they tempted God in the desert.
</p>
<p>
	15 So he gave them their desire, *
</p>
<p>
	and sent leanness into their soul.
</p>
<p>
	16 They were envious of Moses also in the camp, *
</p>
<p>
	and of Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
	17 So the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan *
</p>
<p>
	and covered the company of Abiram,
</p>
<p>
	18 And fire was kindled in their company; *
</p>
<p>
	the flame burnt up the ungodly.
</p>
<p>
	19 They made a calf in Horeb *
</p>
<p>
	and worshiped a molten image.
</p>
<p>
	20 Thus they exchanged their glory *
</p>
<p>
	for the image of a calf that feeds on hay.
</p>
<p>
	21 And they forgot God their Savior, *
</p>
<p>
	who had done great things in Egypt,
</p>
<p>
	22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, *
</p>
<p>
	and fearful things by the Red Sea.
</p>
<p>
	23 So he said he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood
	before him in the gap *
</p>
<p>
	to turn away his wrathful indignation, lest he should destroy them.
</p>
<p>
	24 Then they scorned that pleasant land *
</p>
<p>
	and gave no credence to his word,
</p>
<p>
	25 But murmured in their tents *
</p>
<p>
	and did not hearken to the voice of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
	26 Then he lifted up his hand against them *
</p>
<p>
	to overthrow them in the wilderness,
</p>
<p>
	27 To cast out their seed among the nations, *
</p>
<p>
	and to scatter them in all the lands.
</p>
<p>
	28 They joined themselves to Baal-Peor *
</p>
<p>
	and ate the offerings to the dead.
</p>
<p>
	29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their wanton deeds, *
</p>
<p>
	and the plague broke out among them.
</p>
<p>
	30 Then Phineas stood up and interceded, *
</p>
<p>
	and so the plague was ended;
</p>
<p>
	31 And that was counted to him as righteousness *
</p>
<p>
	among all generations for evermore.
</p>
<p>
	32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, *
</p>
<p>
	so that he punished Moses for their misdeeds;
</p>
<p>
	33 For they provoked him to anger, *
</p>
<p>
	so that he spoke rashly with his lips.
</p>
<p>
	34 Neither did they destroy the peoples *
</p>
<p>
	as the Lord commanded them,
</p>
<p>
	35 But intermingled among the nations *
</p>
<p>
	and learned their heathen ways,
</p>
<p>
	36 So that they worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them; *
</p>
<p>
	they offered their sons and their daughters to demons,
</p>
<p>
	37 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their
	daughters, *
</p>
<p>
	whom they offered to the idols of Canaan; and the land was defiled with
	blood.
</p>
<p>
	38 Thus were they defiled by their own works *
</p>
<p>
	and went whoring with their own deeds.
</p>
<p>
	39 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, *
</p>
<p>
	and he abhorred his own inheritance,
</p>
<p>
	40 And he gave them over into the hands of the nations, *
</p>
<p>
	and those who hated them were lords over them.
</p>
<p>
	41 Their enemies oppressed them *
</p>
<p>
	and held them in subjection.
</p>
<p>
	42 Many a time did he deliver them, *
</p>
<p>
	but they rebelled against him through their own devices, and were brought
	down in their wickedness.
</p>
<p>
	43 Nevertheless, when he saw their adversity, *
</p>
<p>
	when he heard their lamentation,
</p>
<p>
	44 He remembered his covenant and pitied them, according to the multitude
	of his mercies; *
</p>
<p>
	he made all those who led them away captive to pity them.
</p>
<p>
	45 Deliver us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations, *
</p>
<p>
	that we may give thanks to your holy Name and make our boast of your
	praise.
</p>
<p>
	46 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and world without
	end, *
</p>
<p>
	and let all the people say, "Amen." Praise the Lord.

	<em>Confitemini Domino</em>
</p>
<p>
	1 O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, *
</p>
<p>
	and his mercy endures for ever.
</p>
<p>
	2 Let those whom the Lord has redeemed give thanks, *
</p>
<p>
	whom he has delivered from the hand of the enemy,
</p>
<p>
	3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, *
</p>
<p>
	from the north and from the south.
</p>
<p>
	4 They went astray in the wilderness, even in the desert, *
</p>
<p>
	and found no city to dwell in;
</p>
<p>
	5 They were hungry and thirsty, *
</p>
<p>
	and their soul fainted within them.
</p>
<p>
	6 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	and he delivered them from their distress.
</p>
<p>
	7 He led them forth by a straight path *
</p>
<p>
	until they came to a city where they might dwell.
</p>
<p>
	8 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
</p>
<p>
	and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
</p>
<p>
	9 For he satisfies the empty soul *
</p>
<p>
	and fills the hungry soul with goodness.
</p>
<p>
	10 Some sat in darkness, and in the shadow of death, *
</p>
<p>
	being bound fast in misery and iron,
</p>
<p>
	11 Because they rebelled against the words of God *
</p>
<p>
	and lightly regarded the counsel of the Most High.
</p>
<p>
	12 He also brought down their heart with heaviness; *
</p>
<p>
	they fell down, and there was none to help them.
</p>
<p>
	13 Then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	and he delivered them out of their distress.
</p>
<p>
	14 For he brought them out of darkness, and out of the shadow of death, *
</p>
<p>
	and broke their bonds asunder.
</p>
<p>
	15 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
</p>
<p>
	and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
</p>
<p>
	16 For he has broken the gates of brass *
</p>
<p>
	and shattered the bars of iron asunder.
</p>
<p>
	17 The foolish were plagued for their offense *
</p>
<p>
	and because of their wickedness.
</p>
<p>
	18 Their soul abhorred all manner of food, *
</p>
<p>
	and they were even close to death's door.
</p>
<p>
	19 So when they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	he delivered them out of their distress.
</p>
<p>
	20 He sent his word and healed them, *
</p>
<p>
	and they were saved from destruction.
</p>
<p>
	21 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
</p>
<p>
	and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
</p>
<p>
	22 That they would offer unto him the sacrifice of thanksgiving *
</p>
<p>
	and tell of his works with gladness!
</p>
<p>
	23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, *
</p>
<p>
	who carry out their business in great waters,
</p>
<p>
	24 They behold the works of the Lord *
</p>
<p>
	and his wonders in the deep.
</p>
<p>
	25 For at his word the stormy wind arises, *
</p>
<p>
	which lifts up the waves.
</p>
<p>
	26 They are carried up to heaven and down again to the deep; *
</p>
<p>
	their soul melts away because of the trouble.
</p>
<p>
	27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, *
</p>
<p>
	and are at their wits' end.
</p>
<p>
	28 So when they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, *
</p>
<p>
	he delivers them out of their distress.
</p>
<p>
	29 For he makes the storm to cease, *
</p>
<p>
	so that the waves are still.
</p>
<p>
	30 Then they are glad, because they are at rest, *
</p>
<p>
	and so he brings them into the haven where they desire to be.
</p>
<p>
	31 Oh, that they would therefore praise the Lord for his goodness *
</p>
<p>
	and declare the wonders that he does for the children of men!
</p>
<p>
	32 That they would exalt him also in the congregation of the people *
</p>
<p>
	and praise him in the seat of the elders!
</p>
<p>
	33 He turns rivers into a wilderness *
</p>
<p>
	and water-springs into thirsty ground,
</p>
<p>
	34 A fruitful land he makes barren, *
</p>
<p>
	because of the wickedness of those who dwell there.
</p>
<p>
	35 Again, he makes the wilderness into pools of water *
</p>
<p>
	and dry ground into water-springs;
</p>
<p>
	36 And there he sets the hungry *
</p>
<p>
	that they may build a city to dwell in,
</p>
<p>
	37 That they may sow their land and plant vineyards *
</p>
<p>
	to yield the fruits of increase.
</p>
<p>
	38 He blesses them, so that they multiply exceedingly, *
</p>
<p>
	and does not allow their cattle to decrease.
</p>
<p>
	39 And again, when they are diminished and brought low, *
</p>
<p>
	through oppression, through any plague or trouble,
</p>
<p>
	40 Though he pours contempt on princes *
</p>
<p>
	and lets them wander in the pathless wilderness,
</p>
<p>
	41 Yet he helps the poor out of misery *
</p>
<p>
	and increases their households like a flock of sheep.
</p>
<p>
	42 The righteous will consider this and rejoice, *
</p>
<p>
	and the mouth of all wickedness shall be stopped.
</p>
<p>
	43 Whoever is wise will ponder these things, *
</p>
<p>
	and shall understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.

	24 I have become a reproach to them; *
</p>
<p>
	when they look on me, they shake their heads.

<p>
	25 Help me, O Lord my God; *
</p>
<p>
	save me according to your mercy;
</p>
<p>
	26 And they shall know that this is your hand, *
</p>
<p>
	and that you, O Lord, have done it.
</p>
<p>
	27 Though they curse, yet you bless; *
</p>
<p>
	let them be confounded who rise up against me, but let your servant
	rejoice.
</p>
<p>
	28 Let my adversaries be clothed with shame, *
</p>
<p>
	and let them cover themselves with their own disgrace as with a cloak.
</p>
<p>
	29 As for me, I will give great thanks unto the Lord with my mouth, *
</p>
<p>
	and praise him among the multitude,

<p>
	indeed, his wisdom is infinite.
</p>
<p>
	6 The Lord lifts up the meek, *
</p>
<p>
	and brings the ungodly down to the ground.
</p>
<p>
	7 O sing unto the Lord with thanksgiving; *
</p>
<p>
	sing praises with the harp unto our God,
</p>
<p>
	8 Who covers the heavens with clouds, and prepares rain for the earth, *
</p>
<p>
	and makes the grass to grow upon the mountains, and plants for the use of
	men,
</p>
<p>
	9 Who gives food to the cattle *
</p>
<p>
	and feeds the young ravens that call upon him.
</p>
<p>
	10 He has no pleasure in the strength of a horse; *
</p>
<p>
	neither does he delight in any man's strength.
</p>
<p>
	11 But the Lord's delight is in those who fear him *
</p>
<p>
	and put their trust in his mercy.
</p>
<p>
	12 Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; *
</p>
<p>
	praise your God, O Zion.
</p>
<p>
	13 For he has made strong the bars of your gates *
</p>
<p>
	and has blessed your children within you.
</p>
<p>
	14 He makes peace in your borders *
</p>
<p>
	and fills you with the finest of wheat.
</p>
<p>
	15 He sends forth his commandment upon the earth, *
</p>
<p>
	and his word runs very swiftly.
</p>
<p>
	16 He gives snow like wool *
</p>
<p>
	and scatters the white frost like ashes.
</p>
<p>
	17 He casts forth his ice like crumbs; *
</p>
<p>
	who is able to abide his frost?
</p>
<p>
	18 He sends out his word and melts them; *
</p>
<p>
	he blows with his wind, and the waters flow.
</p>
<p>
	19 He declares his word unto Jacob, *
</p>
<p>
	his statutes and ordinances unto Israel.
</p>
<p>
	20 He has not dealt so with other nations; *
</p>
<p>
	neither have they knowledge of his laws. Praise the Lord.
