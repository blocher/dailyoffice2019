    <verse num="3">Then the king commanded Ashpenaz, <crossref let="e" cid="c27001003.1"/>his chief eunuch, to bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family<note nid="n27001003.1"/> and of <crossref let="f" cid="c27001003.2"/>the nobility,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001004"/>
    <verse num="4">youths without <crossref let="g" cid="c27001004.1"/>blemish, of good appearance and <crossref let="h" cid="c27001004.2"/>skillful in all wisdom, endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king&apos;s palace, and to <crossref let="i" cid="c27001004.3"/>teach them the literature and language of the <crossref let="j" cid="c27001004.4"/>Chaldeans.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001005"/>
    <verse num="5">The king assigned them a daily portion of <crossref let="k" cid="c27001005.1"/>the food that the king ate, and of <crossref let="l" cid="c27001005.2"/>the wine that he drank.

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001006"/>
    <verse num="6">Among these were <crossref let="o" cid="c27001006.1"/>Daniel, <crossref let="p" cid="c27001006.2"/>Hananiah, <crossref let="p" cid="c27001006.3"/>Mishael, and <crossref let="p" cid="c27001006.4"/>Azariah of the tribe of Judah.</verse>

    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="8">But Daniel <crossref let="s" cid="c27001008.1"/>resolved that he would not <crossref let="t" cid="c27001008.2"/>defile himself with <crossref let="k" cid="c27001008.3"/>the king&apos;s food, or with <crossref let="l" cid="c27001008.4"/>the wine that he drank. Therefore he asked the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to <crossref let="t" cid="c27001008.5"/>defile himself.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001009"/>
    <verse num="9"><crossref let="u" cid="c27001009.1"/>And God gave Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs,</verse>

    <verse num="10">and the chief of the eunuchs said to Daniel, <q class="begin-double" qid="27001010.1" from="27001010.1" to="27001010.2"/>I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink; for why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age?

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001011"/>

    <verse num="13">Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat <crossref let="k" cid="c27001013.1"/>the king&apos;s food be observed by you, and deal with your servants according to what you see.<q class="end-double" qid="27001013.1" from="27001012.1" to="27001013.1"/></verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001015"/>
    <verse num="15">At the end of ten days it was seen that they were better in appearance and fatter in flesh than all the youths who ate <crossref let="k" cid="c27001015.1"/>the king&apos;s food.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001016"/>
    <verse num="16"><crossref let="w" cid="c27001016.1"/>So the steward took away their food and the wine they were to drink, and gave them <crossref let="x" cid="c27001016.2"/>vegetables.</verse>

    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="17">As for these four youths, <crossref let="y" cid="c27001017.1"/>God gave them learning and <crossref let="z" cid="c27001017.2"/>skill in all literature and wisdom, and Daniel had <crossref let="a" cid="c27001017.3"/>understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001018"/>
    <verse num="18">At the end of <crossref let="b" cid="c27001018.1"/>the time, when the king had commanded that they should be brought in, the chief of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001019"/>
    <verse num="19">And the king spoke with them, and among all of them none was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore <crossref let="c" cid="c27001019.1"/>they stood before the king.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v27001020"/>
    <verse num="20">And in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all <crossref let="d" cid="c27001020.1"/>the magicians and <crossref let="e" cid="c27001020.2"/>enchanters that were in all his kingdom.</verse>
