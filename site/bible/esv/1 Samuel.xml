    <verse num="1">There was a certain man of <crossref let="a" cid="c09001001.1"/>Ramathaim-zophim of <crossref let="b" cid="c09001001.2"/>the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, <crossref let="c" cid="c09001001.3"/>an Ephrathite.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v09001002"/>
    <verse num="2">He had two wives. The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other, Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v09001007"/>
    <verse num="7">So it went on year by year. As often as she went up to the house of the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span>, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.</verse>
