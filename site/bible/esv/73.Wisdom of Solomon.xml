      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73001004"/>
      <verse num="4"><begin-line/>because wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>or dwell in a body enslaved to sin.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73001005"/>
      <verse num="5"><begin-line/>For a holy and disciplined spirit will flee from deceit<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and will rise and depart from foolish thoughts<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and will be ashamed at the approach of unrighteousness.<end-line/></verse>

      <verse num="6"><begin-line/>For wisdom is a kindly spirit and<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>will not free a blasphemer from the guilt of his words,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>because God is witness of his inmost feelings<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and a true observer of his heart and a hearer of his tongue.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73001007"/>
      <verse num="7"><begin-line/>Because the Spirit of the Lord has filled the world,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and that which holds all things together knows what is said;<end-line class="br"/></verse>

      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73001010"/>
      <verse num="10"><begin-line/>because a jealous ear hears all things,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and the sound of murmurings does not go unheard.<end-line class="br"/></verse>

      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014002"/>

      <verse num="6"><begin-line/>For even in the beginning, when arrogant giants were perishing,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>the hope of the world took refuge on a raft<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and guided by your hand left to the world the seed of a new generation.<end-line class="br"/></verse>

      <begin-block-indent/>
      <begin-paragraph class="line-group"/>
      <verse num="12"><begin-line/>For the beginning of fornication was the conception of idols,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and the invention of them was the corruption of life,<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014013"/>

      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014014"/>
      <verse num="14"><begin-line/>For through human vanity they entered the world,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and therefore their speedy end has been planned.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014015"/>
      <verse num="15"><begin-line/>For a father, consumed with grief at an untimely bereavement,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>made an image of his child, who had been suddenly taken from him;<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and he now honored as a god what was once a dead human being<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and handed on to his dependents secret rites and initiations.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014016"/>
      <verse num="16"><begin-line/>Then the ungodly custom, grown strong with time, was kept as a law,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and at the command of monarchs carved images were worshiped.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014017"/>
      <verse num="17"><begin-line/>When people could not honor monarchs<note nid="n73014017.1"/> in their presence, since they lived at a distance,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>they imagined their appearance from far away<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and made a visible image of the king whom they honored,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>so that by their zeal they might flatter the absent one as though present.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014018"/>
      <verse num="18"><begin-line/>Then the ambition of the artisan impelled<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>even those who did not know the king to intensify their worship.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014019"/>
      <verse num="19"><begin-line/>For he, perhaps wishing to please his ruler,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>skillfully forced the likeness to take more beautiful form,<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014020"/>
      <verse num="20"><begin-line/>and the multitude, attracted by the charm of his work,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>now regarded as an object of worship the one whom shortly before they had honored as a human being.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014021"/>
      <verse num="21"><begin-line/>And this became a hidden trap for mankind,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>because people, in bondage to misfortune or to royal authority,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>bestowed on objects of stone or wood the name that ought not to be shared.<end-line/></verse>

      <verse num="25"><begin-line/>and all is a raging riot of blood and murder, theft and deceit, corruption, faithlessness, tumult, perjury,<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014026"/>
      <verse num="26"><begin-line/>confusion over what is good, forgetfulness of favor,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>pollution of souls, sexual perversion,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>disorder in marriage, adultery, and debauchery.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014027"/>
      <verse num="27"><begin-line/>For the worship of idols not to be named<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>is the beginning and cause and end of every evil.<end-line class="br"/></verse>

      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014029"/>

      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014030"/>
      <verse num="30"><begin-line/>But just penalties will overtake them on two counts:<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>because they thought wickedly of God in devoting themselves to idols<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>and because in deceit they swore unrighteously through contempt for holiness.<end-line class="br"/></verse>
      <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v73014031"/>
      <verse num="31"><begin-line/>For it is not the power of the things by which men swear,<note nid="n73014031.1"/><end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>but the just penalty for those who sin,<end-line class="br"/><begin-line/>that always pursues the transgression of the unrighteous.<end-line/></verse>
