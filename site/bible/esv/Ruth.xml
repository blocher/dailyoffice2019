    <verse num="1">In the days <crossref let="a" cid="c08001001.1"/>when the judges ruled there was <crossref let="b" cid="c08001001.2"/>a famine in the land, and a man of <crossref let="c" cid="c08001001.3"/>Bethlehem in Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he and his wife and his two sons.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v08001002"/>
    <verse num="2">The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion. They were <crossref let="d" cid="c08001002.1"/>Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v08001003"/>
    <verse num="3">But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v08001004"/>
    <verse num="4">These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. They lived there about ten years,</verse>

    <verse num="5">and both Mahlon and Chilion died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.</verse>

    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="6">Then she arose with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the fields of Moab that <crossref let="e" cid="c08001006.1"/>the <span class="divine-name">Lord</span> had visited his people and <crossref let="f" cid="c08001006.2"/>given them food.</verse>
