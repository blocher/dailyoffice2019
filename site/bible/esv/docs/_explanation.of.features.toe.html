<h1>Explanation of Features Included in this Edition</h1>
<p><span class="edition">The Digital Edition</span> of the ESV Bible includes a number of valuable features to encourage the reading and study of the Bible. A brief description is provided below explaining the purpose and use of the <span class="edition">ESV Digital Edition</span> features.</p>
<h2>Introductions to Each Book of the Bible</h2>
<p>An introduction is provided at the beginning of each book of the Bible. The purpose of the ESV introductions is to provide basic background information needed to begin to read and understand the books of the Bible on one&#8217;s own. The introductions normally include information about the central content, theme, and message of the book, as well as the time, setting, and author. The introductions intentionally do not address technical questions concerning the text and doctrine, preferring instead to help people read the Bible on their own and discover the timeless truths and riches of God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<h2>Section Headings</h2>
<p>Section headings have been included throughout the text of the <span class="edition">ESV Digital Edition</span>. While the headings are not part of the Bible text itself, they have been provided to help identify and locate important themes and topics throughout the Bible.</p>
<h2>Textual Footnotes</h2>
<p>Several kinds of footnotes related to the ESV text are provided throughout the ESV Bible to assist the reader. These footnotes appear at the bottom of the page and are indicated in the ESV text by a superscript <em>number</em> that <em>follows</em> the word or phrase to which the footnote applies (e.g., &#8220;Isaac<span class="note">2</span>&#8221;). Superscript <em>letters</em> that <em>precede</em> a word are used to indicate cross-references (see explanation below).</p>
<p>The footnotes included in the ESV Bible are an integral part of the text and provide important information concerning the understanding and translation of the text. The footnotes fall mainly into four categories, as illustrated in the examples below.</p>
<h3>Types of Footnotes</h3>
<ol>
	<li><em>Alternative Translations</em>. Footnotes of this kind provide alternative translations for specific words or phrases when there is a strong possibility that such words or phrases could be translated in another way, such as: &#8220;Or <em>keep awake</em>&#8221; (see Matt. 26:38); and &#8220;Or <em>down payment</em>&#8221; (see Eph. 1:14). In such cases, the translation deemed to have the stronger support is in the text while other possible renderings are given in the note.</li>
	<li><em>Explanation of Greek and Hebrew Terms</em>. Notes of this kind relate primarily to the meaning of specific Greek or Hebrew terms, as illustrated by the following examples:
		<ol>
			<li>Notes about the meaning of names in the original languages, such as: &#8220;<em>Isaac</em> means <em>he laughs</em>&#8221; (see Gen. 17:19); and &#8220;<em>Simeon</em> sounds like the Hebrew for <em>heard</em>&#8221; (see Gen. 29:33).</li>
			<li>Notes that give the literal translation of a Greek or Hebrew word or phrase deemed too awkward to be used in the English text, such as: &#8220;Greek <em>girding up the loins of your mind</em>&#8221; (see 1 Pet. 1:13).</li>
			<li>Notes indicating that absolute certainty of the meaning of a word or phrase is not possible given our best understanding of the original language (e.g., Hebrew words occurring so infrequently in the Old Testament that their meaning cannot be determined with certainty). Such words are identified with a note stating that &#8220;The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain&#8221; (see, e.g., Josh. 17:11).</li>
			<li>Notes that indicate the specialized use of a Greek word, such as: &#8220;brothers,&#8221; translating the Greek word <em>adelphoi</em> (see, e.g., the extended note on Rom. 1:13, corresponding to the first occurrence of <em>adelphoi</em> in any New Testament book, and the abbreviated note, e.g., on Rom. 7:1, corresponding to subsequent occurrences of <em>adelphoi</em> in any New Testament book); and &#8220;sons,&#8221; translating the Greek word <em>huioi</em> (see, e.g., Rom. 8:14). See also the discussion of <em>adelphoi</em> and <em>huioi</em> in the preface.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><em>Other Explanatory Notes</em>. Footnotes of this kind provide clarifying information as illustrated by the following examples:
		<ol>
			<li>Notes clarifying additional meanings that may not otherwise be apparent in the text, such as: &#8220;<em>Leprosy</em> was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13.&#8221;</li>
			<li>Notes clarifying important grammatical points that would not otherwise be apparent in English, such as: &#8220;In Hebrew <em>you</em> is plural in verses 1-5&#8221; (see Gen. 3:1).</li>
			<li>Notes clarifying when the referent for a pronoun has been supplied in the English text, such as: &#8220;Greek <em>he</em>&#8221; (see, e.g., Mark 1:43).</li>
			<li>Notes giving English equivalents for weights, measures, and monetary values.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><em>Technical Translation Notes</em>. Footnotes of this kind indicate how decisions have been made in the translation of difficult Hebrew and Greek passages. Such notes occasionally include technical terms. For an explanation of these terms the reader is referred to standard Bible study reference works. See further the section in the preface on &#8220;Textual Basis&#8221; for an explanation of the original-language texts used in the translation of the ESV Bible and how the translation of difficult passages has been resolved.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Cross-reference Footnotes</h2>
<p>In addition to the <em>numeric</em> (textual) footnotes, the New Testament portion of this edition of the ESV Bible includes two kinds of cross-reference notes. These are identified <em>alphabetically</em> and follow the numeric notes at the bottom of each page. These include (1) <em>direct quotations from the Old Testament</em> (indirect quotations and allusions are not included), and (2) <em>parallel passages in the four Gospels</em>. These cross-references are included to help the reader understand the relationship of the New Testament to the Old Testament, and the harmony of the Gospels in the New Testament.</p>
<h2>Maps</h2>
<p>A valuable set of maps is provided at the end of the <span class="edition">ESV Digital Edition</span>. These include maps describing the biblical world and key historical periods in the life of ancient Israel and in New Testament times. Also included are maps showing a comprehensive overview of Jesus&#8217; life and ministry as well as the missionary journeys of the apostle Paul.</p>
