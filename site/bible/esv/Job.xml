    <verse num="5">And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and <crossref let="h" cid="c18001005.1"/>consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and <crossref let="i" cid="c18001005.2"/>offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, <q class="begin-double" qid="18001005.1" from="18001005.1" to="18001005.2"/>It may be that my children have sinned, and <crossref let="j" cid="c18001005.3"/>cursed<note nid="n18001005.1"/> God in their hearts.<q class="end-double" qid="18001005.2" from="18001005.1" to="18001005.2"/> Thus Job did continually.</verse>
