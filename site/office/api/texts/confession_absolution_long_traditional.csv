"The Priest alone stands and says", "rubric"
"Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, desireth not the death of sinners, but that they may turn from their wickedness and live. He hath empowered and commanded his ministers to pronounce to his people, being penitent, the absolution and remission of their sins. He pardoneth and absolveth all who truly repent and unfeignedly believe his holy Gospel. Wherefore we beseech him to grant us true repentance and his Holy Spirit, that our present deeds may please him, the rest of our lives may be pure and holy, and that at the last we may come unto his eternal joy; through Jesus Christ our Lord.","leader"
