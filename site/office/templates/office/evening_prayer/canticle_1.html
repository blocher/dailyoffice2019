<h3>MAGNIFICAT</h3>
<h4>The Song of Mary</h4>
<p><em>Officiant and People, all standing</em></p>

<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>My soul magnifies the Lord, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>For he has regarded *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>the lowliness of his handmaiden.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>For behold, from now on, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>all generations will call me blessed;</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>For he that is mighty has magnified me, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>and holy is his Name.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>And his mercy is on those who fear him, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>throughout all generations.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>He has shown the strength of his arm; *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>and has exalted the humble and meek.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>He has filled the hungry with good things, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>and the rich he has sent empty away.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>He, remembering his mercy, has helped his servant Israel, *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>as he promised to our fathers, Abraham and his seed for ever.</strong></p>
<p class="hanging-indent"><strong>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; *</strong></p>
<p class="indent"><strong>as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.</strong></p>
